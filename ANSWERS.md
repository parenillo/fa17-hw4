1. What is the difference between `new` and `create` for a model?

Cat.save

3. What is the default integer column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?

It's the id column.

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "Kira" in the database?

Cat.create(name: "Kira")

5. How did you like this homework in comparison with the previous homeworks?

I felt like I learned more but I was definitely way more confused. I wouldn't have been able to finish without office hours.
The first parts with the migrations were fine but the last part where we had to put it all together was hard to conceptualize because I wasn't used to the organization and syntax of things.
It would've been so helpful to have a video of the demo from lecture.
